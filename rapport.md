# RD-UPDATE-BILAL

For this course assignement we were given the task to deploy our page on Hotjar, view the recordings, and make changes accordingly.

Immediately I noticed that my page was way to basic, had a lot of empty space, and just did not look appealing in general, as an e-commerce page. In the original site I had the navbar to the left side of the page. I did this because I thought it would be easy to make the site responsive, and easy to understand for the customer. Right away i noticed that I was wrong. Having the navbar to one side was not only hard to work arround, but just did not feel natural for neither the test subjects, or me as the developer. Therefor I chose to put the navbar on the top end of the page so it woud be easier to work with, and feel more natural for the customers. If opened on a phone/tablet you will have a "hamburger" menu, witch leaves a lot of space to work with and show more content on the page, as I am working with a smaller display.

The original page did not have a footer witch made the page just look odd, so I decided to put a footer on the page with some basic information on display. Also instead of having the same page on both phone and pc, I chose to make the page responsive so its more appropriate for all devices.

The form I had on the checkout page was originally not functional, so I replaced the form with a working form with regex, showing errors and success messages. Due to the form showing a success message when finished I did not find it necessary with a "checkout success" page as I figuerd it wuld be quite easy for the subjects to understand that they have successfully ordered an item from the page.
